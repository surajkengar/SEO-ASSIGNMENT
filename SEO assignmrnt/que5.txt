A "favicon," short for favorite icon, is a small, often square-shaped image or icon associated with a website or web page. Favicon images are typically displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, and bookmarks to help users visually identify and distinguish websites.

The primary purpose of a favicon is to enhance the visual branding and recognition of a website. It provides a small but impactful representation of the site, making it easier for users to identify and locate it among their open tabs or bookmarks.

Here's an illustrative example:

Let's consider the favicon for the Google website. If you open the Google homepage in a web browser, you'll notice a small "G" icon in the browser's address bar and tabs. This "G" icon is the favicon for Google. It's a simple yet recognizable representation of the Google brand, and users quickly associate it with the popular search engine.

The favicon not only appears in the browser but may also show up in other places, such as when a user bookmarks a page. It adds a visual element to the site's identity and contributes to a cohesive and memorable user experience. Websites often create custom favicons that align with their brand logo or visual theme to strengthen their online presence.
